# Force handler
# Ansible runs handlers at the end of a play.
#  If a task notifies a handler but another task fails later, the handler won't run by default.
#  Example:
# ○ A task updates a config file and notifies a handler to restart a service.
# ○ If a later task fails — the service won’t restart — even though the config was changed!
# ○ This can leave the host in a broken state.
# You can make sure handlers always run — even if some tasks fail — by:
# ○ Adding --force-handlers to your command line
# ○ Adding force_handlers: True in your playbook
# ○ Adding force_handlers = True in ansible.cfg
# This forces Ansible to run all notified handlers, even on hosts where a task failed.
# (Unless the host is unreachable.)
